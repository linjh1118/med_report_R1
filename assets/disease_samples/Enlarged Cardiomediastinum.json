In addition,\n the mediastinum appears wider on the right side than previously seen as well\n as mildly lobulated.  This appearance could be associated with new\n lymphadenopathy or even a mass in the mediastinum versus primarily increase in\n the size of the aorta.  The lung fields appear clear.  There are no pleural\n effusions or pneumothorax.  Mild compression deformities are similar along the\n mid-to-lower thoracic spine.  These include a moderate anterior wedge\n compression deformity at the thoracolumbar junction that appears similar.",
