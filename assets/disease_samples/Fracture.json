Since the prior radiograph on ___, the T12 vertebral\n body has a worsened compression fracture.  In the previous exam, there is a\n mild compression deformity, but now it has lost greater than ___% of its\n height.  The previously noted sternal fracture is in good alignment.  There is\n diffuse demineralization and small lytic lesions in the remainder of the\n osseous structures, which is consistent with the patient's known multiple\n myeloma.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.",

This is\n probably associated with an area of focal irregularity of the lateral right\n eighth rib, that is consistent with metastatic disease as characterized on\n recent CT.\n \n There is no evidence of CHF, focal consolidation or pneumothorax.
