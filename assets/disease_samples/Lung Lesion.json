Pulmonary vascular congestion as before.

This finding was well visualized on the CT study where only\n spurious evidence of some air could be identified in the more distal depending\n pulmonary parenchymal area.  As can be seen on a chest CT, the bronchus to the\n right upper lobe divides into two major branches, the lower of which supplies\n the mid territory of the right hemithorax and also contains multiple patchy\n infiltrates.

During this two-day examination interval, the patient\n underwent a chest CT examination on ___, which is consequently also\n reviewed.\n \n Enlarged heart size as before.  Permanent pacer in left anterior axillary\n position connected to two-three electrodes including ICD device, right atrial\n wire and left ventricular myocardium stimulation via a trans-coronary-venous\n approach.  Pulmonary vascular congestion as before.  The right-sided pigtail\n catheter remains in the lower lateral portion of the pleural space, and there\n is no evidence of remaining significant pneumothorax in the right apical area.\n The right-sided density in the lower-middle lobe area persists.  Similar as on\n the preceding image of ___, it is impossible to identify the stent which\n apparently was placed in the common bronchus to the right middle lobe and\n lower lobe.  This finding was well visualized on the CT study where only\n spurious evidence of some air could be identified in the more distal depending\n pulmonary parenchymal area.  As can be seen on a chest CT, the bronchus to the\n right upper lobe divides into two major branches, the lower of which supplies\n the mid territory of the right hemithorax and also contains multiple patchy\n infiltrates.  The right-sided infrahilar mass density which in location\n matches the stent does not show evidence of any air-containing pulmonary\n parenchymal tissue distally to the stent.",
