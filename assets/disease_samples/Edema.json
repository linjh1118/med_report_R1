There is also\n greater heterogeneous opacity at the right lung base where there was a similar\n peripheral lung and pleural lesion. First consideration, to exclude multifocal\n lung infection, is unlikely given clinical situation described to me by\n medical house officer. It would appear to be caused by aggressive multifocal\n malignancy, either lung or metastatic breast cancer, per provided history.\n Bilateral diffuse interstitial abnormality has worsened from prior, probably\n edema, perhaps on the background of interstitial lung disease/fibrosis. \n Bilateral pleural effusions are small, but slightly larger.  Heart is not\n enlarged.  There is no pneumothorax.",
